# First Java Program
## Created by Larry Gaitan-Rodriguez, September 2018

## What is it?
In my Computer Science Class, there were two homeworks and two projects. In this first homework,
I was requried to make a program that would take in three measurements of time, Hours, minutes, and seconds. The program will then convert
that data into only seconds. 

## What is it made of?
The main programming language of this class is Java. The required IDE was Dr.Java , which was meant to introduce us to the idea
of a IDE. 

In this program there were some packages used such as the `java.util.Scanner;` and `java.text.DecimalFormat`. 

## Where there any restrictions/requirements?
Only use what I had learned in class up intill that point. I was also required to make meaningful comments and a block comment on the top of the code.

## What did you learn?
I learned about Variables, Data types, Arithmetic Operators, and the idea of packages andconsequently the idea of an object. 

## Hindsight
It was a nice project and I got a A on it. I did however learn to follow instructions very closely because points were taken off for improperly naming the file.
